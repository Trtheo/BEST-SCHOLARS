<div class="panel">
  <p>Scholarships are highly competitive. After all, there are many students around the world trying 
    to get funding for their studies. Although some scholarships depend on
     outstanding academic records (‘merit-based scholarships’), your chances of success are often
     determined by the quality of your application, and whether or not you are in financial need.
      A number of universities in the Rwanda and other countries, including UR, INES Rhuhengeri , RP, and others 
       for example, offer ‘need-blind’ admissions policies, meaning that all students’ applications are considered 
       regardless of their financial situation, with tuition fees then covered at least partly by the school.

<button class="accordion">4.  Can I get a scholarship for graduate study?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>  Yes! In fact, graduate scholarships to study local or abroad tend to be even more common than undergraduate scholarships, due to the fact that universities and governments are often keen to attract highly skilled graduate students, often using graduate scholarships as an incentive.

Dependent on your level of study, there will be different opportunities available. While some scholarship schemes are open to all students, there are also dedicated bachelor's scholarships , master’s scholarships, PhD scholarships, postdoctoral scholarships and 
academic research scholarships.</p>

<button class="accordion">
5.  Where do I go to find scholarship opportunities?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> To find scholarships you are eligible for, it is advised to first look at the information 
    provided by your chosen university and published here at <a href="#">Best Scholars  </a>. Funding information
     will be listed on the university’s website or in the prospectus, and this is also where you’ll find the 
     relevant contact information should you have any questions about scholarship applications.

In many cases you will not be able to apply for university scholarships until you have gained acceptance
 onto a program at the university. If you are relying on a scholarship for funding, please see question five below.

As well as university scholarships (funded by your university), there may also be a range of external
 scholarships you can apply for, such as government scholarships or scholarships funded by organizations or
  charities with an invested interest in higher education. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">6.  Can I apply for a scholarship before being accepted into a university?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> If you’re relying on scholarship funding in order to be able to study, you should let the school in
     question know of your situation. Some schools offer only ‘fully funded’ places, meaning all applicants must have 
     sufficient funding in place. But many allow you to apply to a program before gaining scholarships, on the
      understanding that you let them know as soon as possible if you have to reject the place due to lack of funding .
       If you do not get the scholarship, you should still have time to
     withdraw your university application or find an alternative method of funding before the start of term. </p>
